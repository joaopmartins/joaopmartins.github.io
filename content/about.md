My name is JoÃ£o Martins and I live in Porto, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ 

I'm an engineer with 10 years experience creating robust platforms, building teams from scratch and helping companies to protect and grow the business. I have led teams both onshore and offshore and have managed folks throughout their career journey. This blog is a place to explore interesting tech & security topics as well as personal & career development. I would like to share with you what I have struggled with and what I have learned so far. Thank you for reading!
